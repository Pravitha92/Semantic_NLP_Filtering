# Semantic NLP Filtering for Deep Learning Papers in Virology/Epidemiology

## Project Overview
This project uses semantic NLP techniques to filter, classify, and extract relevant academic papers on virology and epidemiology. Given an initial dataset [collection_with_abstarcts.csv]() from PubMed. The goal is to identify papers that implement deep learning neural network-based solutions in the fields of virology and epidemiology.
