# üß¨ Semantic NLP Filtering for Deep Learning Papers in Virology/Epidemiology

## üìù Project Overview
This project uses semantic NLP techniques to filter, classify, and extract relevant academic papers on virology and epidemiology. Given an initial dataset [collection_with_abstarcts.csv](https://github.com/Pravitha92/Semantic_NLP_Filtering/blob/main/collection_with_abstracts.csv) from [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The goal is to identify papers that implement deep learning neural network-based solutions in the fields of virology/epidemiology.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocess the data
Selected relevant columns (`PMID`, `Title`, `Journal/Book`, and `Abstract`) from the dataset. Filled 213 missing values in the `Abstract` column by combining 
`Title`  and `Journal/Book`, ensured data completeness for further analysis. Following this, data cleaning was applied to standardize the text by converting it 
to lowercase, removing stopwords, and eliminating punctuation, streamlining the dataset for processing.

## üîç Semantic NLP Filtering of Papers
The `Abstract` field, which provides the most detailed insight into each paper's content, is used as the primary source for filtering. Semantic NLP filtering is done in [filtering_DL_papers_virology_epidemiology.ipynb](https://github.com/Pravitha92/Semantic_NLP_Filtering/blob/main/notebooks/filtering_DL_papers_virology_epidemiology.ipynb) to identify papers applying deep learning in virology/epidemiology.
### üß† NLP technique for filtering the papers
SBERT (Sentence-BERT) is used for semantic NLP filtering, enabling more accurate identification of relevant papers based on meaning rather than simple keyword matching. This approach prioritizes contextual understanding to accurately capture deep learning papers to virology/epidemiology.
- **Model Selection:**
    A pretrained SBERT model, `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, chose due to its efficiency and accurate embeddings, making it well-suited for filtering relevant papers. This model provides a good balance of speed (5x faster than other models) and accuracy, making it ideal for filtering relevant papers.
  
- **Defining Target Terms:** 
    Target terms relevant to deep learning in virology/epidemiology were identified, and SBERT-generated embeddings were created for each term. These serve as reference embeddings for semantic comparisons.
  
- **Filtering Process:**
 Each paper‚Äôs Abstract embedding was generated using the SBERT model. By comparing these embeddings with target term embeddings using cosine similarity, a score was calculated to gauge relevance. Papers meeting or exceeding the similarity threshold were retained.

### üìä Effectiveness of Semantic NLP Filtering over Keyword-Based Filtering
- Captures the contextual meaning of abstracts of each paper, recognizing relevant papers even with varied terminology.
- Reduces irrelevant results by minimizing false positives from mere keyword mentions.
- Scales easily, allowing flexible updates to target terms for ongoing research.
By focusing on the overall meaning of each paper‚Äôs abstract, this approach enables more precise filtering and captures a broader set of relevant papers.

## üóÇ Classification of Papers 
Classified papers using [classification_papers1.py](https://github.com/Pravitha92/Semantic_NLP_Filtering/blob/main/notebooks/classification_papers1.py) by checking for specific keywords related to **text mining**, **computer vision**, **both** or **other**. The script examines combined text fields (`Abstract`, `Title`, and `Journal`) to assign the appropriate classification and extract relevant methods.

```python
    def classify_paper(self, row):
        text = f"{row['Abstract']} {row['Title']} {row['Journal']}".lower()
        contains_text_mining = any(keyword in text for keyword in self.text_mining_keywords)
        contains_computer_vision = any(keyword in text for keyword in self.computer_vision_keywords)
        contains_both = any(keyword in text for keyword in self.both_keywords)

        if contains_both:
            return "both"
        elif contains_text_mining:
            return "text mining"
        elif contains_computer_vision:
            return "computer vision"
        return "other"

```

## üîì  Extract the Name of the Method
To provide deeper insights, extracts specific terms related to deep learning methods from each paper‚Äôs content. This step identifies and lists methods by matching each `Abstract`, `Title`, and `Journal` with keywords across four categories. The extracted methods are saved in a `methods_used` column for further analysis.

```python
    def extract_method_name(self, row):
        content = f"{row['Abstract']} {row['Journal']} {row['Title']}".lower()
        methods = [kw for kw in self.text_mining_keywords + self.computer_vision_keywords + self.both_keywords + self.other_keywords if re.search(rf'\b{kw}\b', content)]
        return ', '.join(set(methods)) if methods else "None"

```

## üéØ Resulting Dataset Statistics
* **Total Records:** 11,450 papers (original count before filtering)
* **Filtered Dataset:** After applying semantic filtering to the `Abstract` field, only **730 relevant papers** to deep learning in virology/epidemiology were kept.
* **Filtered Out Percentage:** Approximately **6.38%  of the papers are relevant** for further analysis, 93.62% of the papers were filtered out as irrelevant.

* **Classification Results:**
The papers were classified into the following categories based on the techniques they apply:
   - **Both (Text Mining & Computer Vision)**: 316 papers
   - **Text Mining**: 165 papers
   - **Computer Vision**: 35 papers
   - **Other (Not directly related to primary focus)**: 214 papers
